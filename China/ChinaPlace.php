        <p id="drplace2">Comic City is a subway stop that has a bunch of Anime and cartoon merchandise. Everything from Dragon Ball Z to One Piece was on display. If youâ€™re an anime fan I recommend stopping by and shopping here. I ended up buying a Gogeta figure which was very high quality. I want to go back very badly.  </p>
