        <p id="familytext">China was a very interesting and unique place to visit. I didn’t understand the language or culture unlike Puerto Rico or the Dominican Republic. It was nice getting to learn about China while exploring it. I also was very interested in China’s government due to their government being vastly different from the US. Something that I did find very funny but interesting nonetheless was my interactions with locals. A lot of the locals have never seen anyone with dad’s or my skin color. So a lot of people were staring at us and taking pictures which I found funny. Also apparently the Caribbean isn’t too well known in China with conversations I had with some of the locals and business people during the Canton Fair; they all had thought the Dominican Republic was in Africa.   </p>
